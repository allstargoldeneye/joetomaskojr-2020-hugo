      Joe Tomasko Jr. is a one of a kind artist that blends electronic pen and tablet with creativity I can only assume is completely devine in nature. My only concern is that I will only become so in need of his talent that I will either run out of money or space in my home for his works (not sure which may come first). If you are truly blessed you will be gifted one of his infamous drawings that he creates without his hands (if you know what I mean). All in all this up and coming creator - more the "THE CREATOR" - is someone that you need to have a piece of art from on each wall of every room in your homeclientThumb : images/client-logo/clients-2.jpg
